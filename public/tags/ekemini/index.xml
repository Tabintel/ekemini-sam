      <description>In 2015, I graduated from high school, next thing was to apply and hope to get into university. I wrote the first JAMB and applied for admission, then there was still POST UTME, went for the test, but didnâ€™t meet up the cut-off mark.
2016, I took another JAMB, this time for a different school, I got the admission but had to defer to the next year (postpone the admission).</description>
