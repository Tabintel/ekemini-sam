      <description>In 2015, I graduated from high school, next thing was to apply and hope to get into university. I wrote the first JAMB and applied for admission, then there was still POST UTME, went for the test, but didn‚Äôt meet up the cut-off mark.
2016, I took another JAMB, this time for a different school, I got the admission but had to defer to the next year (postpone the admission).</description>

      <description>Yay!üòé- I turn 23 today. I‚Äôve been doing some reflection and listed 23 things I have learned (still learning) over the past years.
2023, the Jordan year.
Stay hungry
To maintain your zest for life, it&amp;rsquo;s important to stay Hungry.
Note that, this does not imply that you starve yourself. I&amp;rsquo;m saying, don&amp;rsquo;t get complacent.
A typical example:
You&amp;rsquo;ve been working all day and you feel so hungry. That hunger in you fuels your energy to find food as fast as you can.</description>
