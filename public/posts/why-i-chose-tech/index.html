      <div class="post-content">
        
        <p>In <strong>2015</strong>, I graduated from high school, next thing was to apply and hope to get into university. I wrote the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Admissions_and_Matriculation_Board"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JAMB</a> and applied for admission, then there was still <a href="https://mystudentkit.com/blog/difference-between-jamb-and-post-utme/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POST UTME</a>, went for the test, but didnâ€™t meet up the cut-off mark.</p>
<p><strong>2016</strong>, I took another JAMB, this time for a different school, I got the admission but had to defer to the next year (postpone the admission).</p>
<p><strong>2017</strong>, while waiting to begin college, I registered as an apprentice to learn computer hardware repairs. Growing up, my Dad had introduced me to computers and I got interested at an early age.</p>
<p>Started learning PC repairs in February, and I loved it! By June/July I had gotten the hang of it and kept on with it throughout the year.</p>
<p>January <strong>2018</strong>, I began university to study Chemical engineering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ðŸš¶ Backstory: I&rsquo;d wanted to study Computer engineering, but I yielded to peer pressure, as it seemed <em>Chemical engineering was a big course</em>, now I know better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my first semester, 100L - I&rsquo;d already thought of switching to another department - Computer Science, but didnâ€™t. Told myself, I&rsquo;ll try and continue with the course I was studying.</p>
<p>At this time, I became known for repairing laptops, installing software, and formatting&hellip; so it became my side hustle. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p>Later that year, I got interested in coding and tried to learn HTML with <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sololearn</a>. Although my first time researching about programming was in 2016, my Mom had told me there was this stuff some guys were talking about in her office - <a href="https://www.python.org/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a></p>
<p>So I kept on with Sololearn but wasnâ€™t serious with it, tried it once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>2019</strong>, 200L in university - I continued with Chemical engineering and my side hustle. I practised coding maybe once in 5 months or so.</p>
<p><strong>2020</strong> - During the lockdown period, began learning Python on my phone, didnâ€™t have a PC then. Heard about Go later in the year, got interested and also started learning.
I still was not consistent with it.</p>
<p><strong>2021</strong>, resumed school and paused coding. Around December, I started an internship at an LPG plant, still chemical engineering related.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve observed the patterns along the years, I was not entirely focused on one thing, going back and forth. Deep down, I knew I did not want to continue with Chemical engineering, it wasnâ€™t making sense to me. But I was afraid, to make that bold step and <em>quit</em>. Yes, we all hear, don&rsquo;t give up, but sometimes, there are things you need to <em>quit</em>, so you go all in on another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2022</strong>, the internship continued till Q3. It was a great experience, I learnt important lessons from it.</p>
<p>Amid the IT, I made out some time to learn Go, then I began writing about what I was learning. Read my first article <a href="https://dev.to/envitab/a-new-era-web-2-and-web-3-differences-19hf"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and the second <a href="https://dev.to/envitab/documenting-my-learning-journey-6ef"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Before then, I knew about Technical writing and even recommended it to a friend. But I had not started it at that time.</p>
<p>Q4 2022, I talked with myself, and did some reflection on the patterns throughout the years, being inconsistent, not focused on one thing, and wasn&rsquo;t active in tech communities. I believed I was interested in tech, I saw it as something I would commit to, as a career path.</p>
<p>During this time, I was at a low point, if things had to change for good, my actions needed to change in the right direction. For me, that direction was just taking one step at a time.</p>
<p>I began researching extensively, I needed something I could start doing. I tried applying for remote internships and got many rejection emails. I did Data labelling and writing tasks on some platforms.</p>
<p><strong>2023</strong>, the rebirth. In January, I switched from chemical engineering and went all in on what I wanted to do - Tech.</p>
<p>To answer the question from the title of this article, I chose Tech because it&rsquo;s a path I resonate with. Yes, that&rsquo;s it, simple!</p>
<p>I like music, the process of creating beats and rhythms. I play drums and later on, will go into music production, maybe as a hobby.</p>
<p>At the moment, I got into Tech 6 years ago, although the first year was majorly hardware tech.
However, it&rsquo;s been 9 months of being consistent, and taking one step at a time. I&rsquo;m grateful for the progress I&rsquo;ve made, got to meet amazing people.</p>
<p>And also contributing to great projects like <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildHubb?s=20"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuildHubb</a> and <a href="https://www.depths.so/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Depths.</a></p>
<p>One of the highlights so far was speaking at a tech event on <strong>Technical Writing</strong>. âœ¨ See some <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7088830803895304192/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jpegs.</a></p>
<p>As I mentioned in this <a href="https://dev.to/envitab/ekeminis-tech-journey-10an"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>, I&rsquo;m focused on Go backend development and Technical writing.</p>
<p>This is my story, it&rsquo;s a journey, taking one step at a time, consistently.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s this quote by <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken#mainContent"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Frost</a> that I like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two roads diverged in the woods, and I, I took the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My advice to myself in 2018 would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ekemini, you know what you want, be focused, and consistent with it. Even though it&rsquo;s not all laid out, one step at a time, you&rsquo;ll find your way.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cheers! ðŸ¥‚ Thanks for reading till the end.</p>
