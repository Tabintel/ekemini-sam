There comes a point in everyone’s journey where you hit a wall, and it's not just a wall made of brick or stone—it’s a wall made of everything you’ve been carrying for months, maybe years. A buildup of thoughts, emotions, projects, and expectations, slowly weighing down on you until it’s no longer sustainable. And that’s when you realize: it’s time for a reset.

I’ve been there. In fact, not too long ago, I found myself in that space. The goals I’d set for myself were big—huge, actually—things like building Envitab, diving deep into product management, and even working towards a future relocation. I’ve had to balance multiple roles, from technical writing to software development, to leading projects—all of which I love. But somewhere in between, I had to pause and ask myself if I was moving in the right direction or just moving, period.

And so, I reset.

What Does It Mean to Reset?
For me, resetting doesn’t mean starting over from scratch. It’s more like revisiting the blueprint. A reset means reflecting on what’s working, what’s not, and having the courage to change course if needed. It’s a personal audit. It’s being honest with yourself and making space to breathe, recalibrate, and take a more aligned step forward.

Resetting is also about letting go. Letting go of old versions of yourself, letting go of expectations from others, and even your own expectations that no longer serve your vision. It’s about clearing the clutter in your mind, your calendar, and your life, so you can focus on what truly matters.

My Own Reset Moments
1. The Envitab Project
Envitab has been a labor of love, and while it’s progressing beautifully, I’ve had moments where I needed to step back. In the process of leading the product, managing cross-functional teams, and working on building something meaningful for waste management, I had to take a breather. That reset allowed me to re-energize and approach the project with clearer intentions, improving how I manage the development phases and communicate with the team.

2. Career Growth & Transition
When I transitioned into product management, I had no idea I was stepping into something that would challenge and stretch me. I went from being solely focused on coding to realizing the importance of strategy, business models, and user needs. Every now and then, I needed to reset—to remind myself why I’m doing this and to keep refining my skills.

3. Personal Growth
Personally, resetting has been about making room for better habits—things like prioritizing my mental health, spending time in prayer and reflection, and creating better balance between work and life. It’s easy to get caught up in the hustle, but the pause—the reset—has always led me back to clarity.

How to Know When It’s Time to Reset
If you’re feeling overwhelmed or stuck, that’s usually the first sign. If progress feels like it’s stalling or if you’re constantly drained, it may be time to hit the reset button.
Here are a few tips I’ve found helpful:

Step away: Take time to unplug and reflect. Go for a walk, meditate, or journal your thoughts.
Reassess your goals: Ask yourself if your current goals still align with where you want to be.
Prioritize self-care: Rest, recharge, and take care of your body and mind.
Make a plan: Once you’re clear on the changes you need, put together a realistic plan of action.
Embracing the Power of the Reset
The beauty of a reset is that it doesn’t signify failure. It’s about self-awareness and empowerment. Whether it’s a minor shift or a major overhaul, resetting allows you to align yourself with what truly matters, leaving behind what no longer serves you.

So if you find yourself at a crossroads or feeling weighed down, give yourself the gift of a reset. You might just find that it’s exactly what you need to move forward—stronger, wiser, and with renewed purpose.

Until next time,
