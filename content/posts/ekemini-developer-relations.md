### Why I Chose CUDOS Intercloud

[CUDOS Intercloud](https://www.cudos.org/intercloud) is a pioneering solution in AI, blockchain, and decentralized computing. It provides secure Virtual Machines (VMs) and GPU resources, enabling developers to deploy AI models and decentralized applications efficiently. As a DevRel professional, my role would be to bridge the gap between CUDOS and developers by making these tools more accessible.
