i didn't directly choose product management.

when i joined buildhubb in may 2023, i did as a technical writer. i saw their post on twitter, and added a comment on why it's important to document the product development process, which is where i come in.

at buildhubb, we operate in cohorts. each cohort, working on a particular product.  

my work involved communicating with the designers, developers, marketers and social media managers, to get their weekly updates and document their progress.

cohort II applications opened and i started conducting interviews, assessments and setting up the team.

by this time, i noticed i was already involved in product management. 

so that's how i started and i'm still at it.
 
recently i've been asking the question: "Ekemini, who are you?"

for a long time i thought it was about consistency. but i think i'm consistent!

since January 2023, i have gone to a workspace everyweek, at least 2 or days per week, sometimes 6 and even on Sundays.

today is 15th February 2024. that's 13 months of being consistent.

there should be a certain level of progress.

basic needs - food, accomodation, internet, clothes, transportaion and a steady source of income must be available.

what have i really been doing all this time?

i need to be financially free!

resources i have:
- internet
- laptop
- button phone, and an android that goes off anytime.
- information

how can i earn and get wealth from these? what needs to be done?

currently i dont know the answer. but there's one thing i know. there's a better life, one with freedom in my finances, location and time. driving the best cars, traveling around the world, living in the best apartments, supporting myself, friends and family.

i can acheive it, and i will do all it takes!

what do i do with my time atm.

most days:

- Sunday - workout, Church, eat, open PC, check for tasks, attend meetings, sleep.
- Monday to Saturday - workout, go to workspace, eat, go home, meetings, sleep.

the life i want
- Sunday in my apartment, workout, eat, drive to Church, drive home, chill, eat, attend meeting, sleep.
- Monday to Saturday - go to gym, eat, drive home, work at home in my WFH setup, vibe and chill, grow.

what i need to live the life
- steady sources of $1,000+ income.

the question now is how do i achieve this? 

a good thing to note here is that I have earned above $1,000. i created user guides on how to integrate an S3 amazon storage bucket on another storage platform.

what next do I do?

it has to be fast, with speed.

- who am i?
- why am i here?
- what do i want?

i want to connect with my true being, my soul, myself.

how to succeed?

- concentration
- depth

1. work with focus
2. work deep 

"when we work with focus, and we work deep, we succeed!"

2024 - this is my year of turning pro, Ekemini Samuel

now what should we "work on" - with focus and depth.

work and luck
