Hola, 👋🏾 Ekemini Samuel is my name. I create technical articles - API Documentaion, White Papers and other forms of Technical Content.

On the path to becoming a Go developer, building efficient services. I love music, and will go into music production. Playing drums is my go-to vibe. 

* Code
* Words
* Music

These three things are my trifecta. 🩶 

I speak at tech events on getting into technical writing. If interested, read about my [23 years reflections.](https://envitab.hashnode.dev/23-things-i-have-learned-at-23-in-2023)
